# Todo App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a Todo Application developed using Flutter, Firebase and Firestore as its database. As a user, I want to be able to create and manage a list of tasks or todos on my mobile device. The app allows me to add, edit, and delete tasks. The app also sync todos across multiple devices and provide real-time updates.
